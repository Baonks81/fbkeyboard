fbkeyboard
---

This is a very simple on-screen keyboard with no static files or library dependencies. The only requirement is a working framebuffer device, touchscreen device and the `fbsplash` utility.

Originally created to potentially provide an alternative unlocking method for postmarketOS, that does not depend on upstream packages.


Building
---

1. `make`
2. Resulting binary is in `bin/`.
